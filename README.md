## ML Model for Text Classification

 - In this notebook, we implement a text classification task using machine learning.
 - We create basic NLP based features that can be created from the text and then test the model on the test data set to evaluate it's performance.
 
To make things interesting, the task is to build a machine learning model to **classify** whether a particular tweet is **hate speech** or **not**.
